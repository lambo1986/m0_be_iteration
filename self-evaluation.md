# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
***To iterate over each element in the array.*** 
```
{
array.each do |x| 
  puts x + 1
end
}
```
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
***I need to get better at taking notes. Thinking about printing out certain pages from the lesson to have as notes, especially the practice questions. I also want to learn how to combine previous lessons with this one, so I can understand how everything can work together.***
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment? ***I looked over the lesson before bed last night, and then when I worked on it this morning, it wasn't so confusing. It's really nice to have the little video clips in the lesson as well. I really appreciate that as a student.***
